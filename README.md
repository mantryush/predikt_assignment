# Predikt Data Onboarding Project

This repository contains two separate data fetchers:
1. **Energy Charts Scraper** – Fetches historical electricity spot prices from Energy-Charts API.
2. **MarketWatch Futures Scraper** – Scrapes futures data from MarketWatch.

Each module is structured independently, with its own source code, data storage, and processing logic.
